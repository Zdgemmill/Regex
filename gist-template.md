# Introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex)

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. They provide a concise and flexible way to search, match, and manipulate text based on specific patterns. Whether you're validating user input, searching for patterns in text, or performing complex text transformations, regex can be an invaluable asset in your toolkit.

## Summary

In this document, we'll explore various components of regular expressions and how they work together to define search patterns. We'll cover anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, the OR operator, flags, and character escapes. Each component plays a crucial role in defining the behavior of a regex pattern.

## Regex Components

### Anchors


### Quantifiers
Quantifiers determine the number of occurrences of a character or group. They include * (zero or more), + (one or more), ? (zero or one), and {} (specific number).

\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}

This matches a phone number pattern with three digits, followed by a hyphen, three digits, another hyphen, and four digits.

### Grouping Constructs
Grouping constructs allow combining multiple characters into a single unit for operations like matching and quantification. They are denoted by ().

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions match any one character inside the brackets. They include [...] and [^...] for negation.
### Character Classes
Character classes match specific sets of characters. They include shorthand expressions like \d (digit), \w (word character), \s (whitespace), and their negations.


### The OR Operator
The OR operator (|) allows matching either one pattern or another.


### Flags
Flags modify the behavior of the regex pattern. They include g (global), i (case insensitive), m (multiline), and s (dotall).
### Character Escapes
Character escapes allow matching special characters literally. For example, \. matches a literal dot.
